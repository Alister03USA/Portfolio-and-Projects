Data Science and AI Projects Description

1. Marketing Campaign Analysis
   - Data Analysis, Visualization, and applying Machine Learning on the Marketing Campaign Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/customer-personality-analysis
  
3. Image Classification for differentiating African and Asian Elephants
   - Image Classification using CNNs and Keras: Apply the Xception Model to train (940 Elephant images) and test (188 Elephant images) with an accuracy of 0.87

4. S&P500 Stock Prediction Using Machine Learning
- Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict short-term movements in the S&P 500 index using historical market data. The project involved:
    - Data Engineering: Created features including daily Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and the subsequent day's price to establish a binary target variable for upward price movement.
    - Model Development: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier with tuned hyperparameters (n_estimators=100, min_samples_split=100) to forecast daily market trends.
    - Backtesting & Evaluation: Designed a rolling backtesting framework to iteratively train and test the model on sequential periods, ensuring robust performance assessment.
    - Achieved measurable precision in predicting daily upward movement (only 55% accuracy - need further improvement).
    - Visualization & Insights: Combined actual vs. predicted outcomes to visually analyze model performance and assess prediction accuracy over time.
 
4. Data Science For Public Good Program: AI Chatbot for Housing Data
   - Applied Llamaindex and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to fine-tune Ollama and Mistral LLMs using housing datasets, contributing to an AI chatbot that was successfully tested and presented to support rural Iowan communities with housing concerns.
   - Preprocessed satellite imagery data using Python to integrate geographic context into the LLM training process, improving chatbot accuracy for housing-related questions.
  
5. Housing Price Prediction: Machine Learning
   - Use KNIME Analytics Software to train the housing data using various Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost) and calculate the accuracy, MME, R^2, etc, of each model together with its prediction of housing prices. Random Forest        Model is the best performing model for the dataset
  
6. ARCGIS Dashboard: Jackson Tri-County Dashboard
   - Collected and analyzed opioid-related data from federal health databases, creating visual reports to identify community-level trends using R
   - Conducted geocoding and spatial analysis in R to map incident locations and reveal regional hotspots for opioid-related activity
   - Built an interactive Jackson Tri-County dashboard in ArcGIS Online to visualize opioid trends and other key community measures; findings were prepared for submission to local authorities for policy and intervention planning

7. R Shiny Dashboard: Lincoln County, Nebraska
